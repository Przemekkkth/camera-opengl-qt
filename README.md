# Camera OpenGL Qt/C++
This project demonstrates the implementation of a 3D camera concept in an application utilizing OpenGL and the Qt framework in C++. 
The application showcases basic techniques for rendering a 3D scene and interacting with the camera, such as rotation, zoom, and panning.
This project based on [learnopengl-website](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera) and [qt-example](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-cube-example.html) projects.
